Hey Everyone, To whoever reading this, I wish you'll get a good wife or husband :)
Just Kidding XD
My name is Swar Soni and this is my first ever project I've created on this platform....
You can also say I've made a debut as I am new over here... Looking forward to create more projects further ;)

About The Code:
So this code is basically a game made out of C Language in which it will take any random number and it will not tell it to you.
Your task is to guess that correct number and on the basis of your guesses it will tell you whether that specific number is higher or lower than the actual number.
Be careful as it will also tell you how many guesses you've taken to identify that particular number.
You can play it with a friend and the rule is preety simple, the person who correctly guessed the number in the least amount of guesses wins :)


So yeah... You can enjoy the game and even support my code further... 

Regards,
Swar :)
